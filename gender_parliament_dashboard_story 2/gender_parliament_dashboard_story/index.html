        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Achieving gender equality in political representation is a key goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, which calls for women’s full and effective participation in leadership at all levels. However, women remain significantly underrepresented in national parliaments across the Pacific region, with many countries still falling below <span class="highlight-blue">10%</span> female representation. This gap is driven by persistent structural and societal barriers, such as entrenched patriarchal norms, limited access to resources, and weak institutional support for women leaders.</p>
        <p>This underrepresentation is more than just a statistic—it reflects broader exclusion from political power and impacts the inclusiveness and responsiveness of governance. Research shows that greater participation of women in politics leads to more equitable and people-centered policymaking, especially in areas like health, education, and social protection.</p>
        <p>To highlight these gender gaps and promote data-driven action, this interactive dashboard visualizes trends in women’s parliamentary representation across Pacific countries from 2000 to 2023. The tool enables users to explore progress and setbacks, compare countries over time, and supports efforts to strengthen women’s political empowerment in the region.</p>

      <h2><span class="icon-alert">⚠️</span> Problem Analysis: Why Does the Gender Gap Persist?</h2>
      <p>Despite global commitments to gender equality, women’s representation in Pacific parliaments remains persistently low. The data from 2000 to 2023 shows that most Pacific countries have consistently had less than <span class="highlight-blue">10%</span> female parliamentary participation, with only a few exceptions reaching moderate or high levels. This chronic underrepresentation is not merely a statistical issue—it reflects deep-rooted structural and cultural barriers, including patriarchal norms, limited access to political networks, and insufficient institutional support for women candidates.</p>
      <p>While some countries, such as Palau and Samoa, have experienced sporadic improvements or brief spikes in women’s representation, these gains are often not sustained over time. The majority of nations, like the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu, show little to no significant growth, indicating that progress is slow and uneven across the region. Even in countries that have achieved moderate or high representation, such as French Polynesia and New Caledonia, these cases are rare and not indicative of a broader regional trend.</p>
