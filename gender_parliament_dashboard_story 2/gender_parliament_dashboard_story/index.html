        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Achieving gender equality in political representation is a cornerstone of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: 
          <span class="highlight-blue">“Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”</span>
          Specifically, Target 5.5 calls for ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite growing global awareness, women remain significantly underrepresented in national parliaments across the Pacific region and in other Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In many of these countries, female parliamentary representation still falls below <span class="highlight-red-bg">10%</span>, well under the global average. This disparity reflects long-standing structural and societal barriers, including entrenched patriarchal norms, male-dominated political systems, limited access to campaign financing and networks, and weak institutional support for aspiring women leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          This underrepresentation is not merely a statistical issue—it symbolizes broader exclusion from political power and influence, which directly impacts the inclusiveness and responsiveness of governance. Research consistently shows that greater participation of women in politics leads to more equitable and people-centered policymaking, particularly in areas such as health, education, social protection, and gender-based violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help illuminate these gender gaps and promote data-informed action, we have developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes trends in women’s parliamentary representation across Pacific countries from 2000 to 2023. This tool draws on reliable, openly accessible data provided by the Pacific Community (SPC), which monitors political participation indicators throughout the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dashboard offers a dynamic and accessible platform for policymakers, researchers, civil society actors, journalists, and the general public to explore long-term progress and setbacks in gender equality in political representation. It enables cross-country comparisons over time, highlights both success stories and areas of concern, and supports the development of evidence-based strategies to strengthen women’s political empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By making this data transparent and easy to explore, the dashboard serves as both an accountability mechanism and an advocacy tool. It reinforces the fundamental democratic principle that all citizens—regardless of gender—should have an equal voice in shaping their nation’s future.

      <h2>Top 5 Insights</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Persistent low levels:</strong> Most Pacific nations have had less than 10% female parliamentary participation for decades.</li>
        <li><strong>Sporadic improvement:</strong> Countries like Palau showed spikes in representation, suggesting event-based or policy-driven shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>Flat progression trend:</strong> Most nations, such as Marshall Islands, show no significant growth in participation over 20+ years.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-2010 momentum:</strong> Many shifts upward begin to appear after 2010, potentially reflecting global SDG initiatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy implications:</strong> The data supports a clear need for systemic reforms and affirmative action to drive meaningful progress by 2030.</li>
