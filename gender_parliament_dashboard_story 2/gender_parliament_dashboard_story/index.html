<p>
  Achieving gender equality in political representation is a key goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, which calls for women’s full and effective participation in leadership at all levels. However, women remain significantly underrepresented in national parliaments across the Pacific region, with many countries still falling below <span class="highlight-red-bg">10%</span> female representation. This gap is driven by persistent structural and societal barriers, such as entrenched patriarchal norms, limited access to resources, and weak institutional support for women leaders.
</p>
<p>
  This underrepresentation is more than just a statistic—it reflects broader exclusion from political power and impacts the inclusiveness and responsiveness of governance. Research shows that greater participation of women in politics leads to more equitable and people-centered policymaking, especially in areas like health, education, and social protection.
</p>
<p>
  To highlight these gender gaps and promote data-driven action, this interactive dashboard visualizes trends in women’s parliamentary representation across Pacific countries from 2000 to 2023. The tool enables users to explore progress and setbacks, compare countries over time, and supports efforts to strengthen women’s political empowerment in the region.

      <h2>Top 5 Insights</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Persistent low levels:</strong> Most Pacific nations have had less than 10% female parliamentary participation for decades.</li>
        <li><strong>Sporadic improvement:</strong> Countries like Palau showed spikes in representation, suggesting event-based or policy-driven shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>Flat progression trend:</strong> Most nations, such as Marshall Islands, show no significant growth in participation over 20+ years.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-2010 momentum:</strong> Many shifts upward begin to appear after 2010, potentially reflecting global SDG initiatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy implications:</strong> The data supports a clear need for systemic reforms and affirmative action to drive meaningful progress by 2030.</li>

      <h2>Recommendation & Call to Action</h2>
      <p>
        To accelerate progress toward gender equality in Pacific parliaments, it is crucial for governments, civil society, and international partners to strengthen support for women’s political participation. This includes implementing affirmative policies, investing in leadership training, and fostering inclusive political environments. <span class="highlight-blue">Let’s work together to ensure every woman has an equal voice in shaping the future of her country.</span>
